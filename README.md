# odin-landing-page

This project utilizes HTML and CSS to replicate a landing page provided by the Odin project. I used flexbox to organize the layout. This project was a really fun opportunity to apply the skills I amassed. Breaking up the page into sections really helped streamline and organize the whole process.
